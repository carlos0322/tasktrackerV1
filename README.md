In this site we havea task tracker where we can add task, save, edit, and delete.

so from line 2 to 4 i am targeting my classes from my html

lines 14 to 16 i createded an alerta to let the user know to type inside the add task box

Line 19 to 44 im using the create elemnet method. the classlist.add, the innertext, the appendchild and the inner html.

from lines 47 to 55 I created a promtpt to edit my task

from line 58 to 71 i created a function to make my buttons work

from 74 to 82 we are telling it to save our data to our localstorage

from 84 to 93 we are telling it to delete it from our local storage

from 95 to 127 i have a function and if that function works properly it will display our added task on our site

Some difficulties i ran into while working this project were trying to make my edit button work so i had to use a promt if i wanted to edit my task and i had a hard time trying to implement the .FS since this concept is still new to me,. I did watch countless videos and i still wasnt able to implement it but in the near future i will go back and see where i went wrong.
